# RockPaperScissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game made with python

## .py to .exe ##
If you want to change a .py file to .exe:
1. open cmd as admin
2. type 'pip install pyinstaller'
3. close the cmd and go to the location of the file you want to change
4. open the cmd in the location
5. type 'pyinstaller --onefile -w {nameoffile}' IMPORTANT do not put '-w' if your program is using the cmd prompt
6. done!

## PLEASE READ ##
I do not make or distribute virus'/malware but I highly suggest when downloading any sort
of code, even if it is from someone that your trust, that you read through the file before running it to make
sure that there is nothing suspicious is going on in the background or behind your back.
